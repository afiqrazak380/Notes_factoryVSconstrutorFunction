//====
//"new" is a keyword in JavaScript syntax. It is used when creating instances of objects from constructor functions. 
//When you use "new" followed by a constructor function, 
//it creates a new object and sets the constructor function as the prototype of that object. 
//This allows you to create instances of custom objects with their own unique properties and methods.
